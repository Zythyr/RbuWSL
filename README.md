# RbuWSL: Rsync backup using Windows Subsystem for Linux

README is pending. More coming soon. 

## Description
RbuWSL's script will backup your desired data on Windows 10 to an external drive using rsync. Rsync allows differential backup of data allowing only new/modified files to be transferred. On Windows 10, use of rsync can be achieved using Ubuntu (Bash) through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

### Motivation
I needed a faster method to quickly backup all my files on Windows to an external drive. Copying/pasting my users files took too long because non-modified files would be transferred also. With 500GB+ worth of data, this was not a feasible option. I found *rsync* as a solution. Rsync allows you to transfer files from source to destination quickly by only transferring new and modified files. I created RbuWSL for my own personal use so I can quickly automate the backup process to an external drive using rsync. 

## Usage
## Requirements

## How to run
1. Edit the constants in this script and tailor for your backup needs. All constants can be found in the CONSTANTS section of the script. 
2. Run Ubuntu (bash) on Windows 10
3. Navigate to location of this script 
4. Run the script by typing the command: ./RbuWSL.sh
## Example
## Suggestions 
* Use the rsync option `-avhP --stats --delete` for basic use. 
	* These options will duplicate your source backup files onto the destination drive. The `--delete` option will be ensure to delete the files in the destination drive that no longer exist your source files. 
* Use the option `--no-p --chmod=ugo=rwX` to ensure no ACL permission issues occur. 
	* This is NOT really needed when using Ubuntu/Bash WSL on Windows. 
	* I use this option because I am paranoid of getting unaccessible files/folders due to ACL permission issues I had in the past when using rsync with Cygwin. Refer to https://superuser.com/a/1184342/607501 for more details.
* Do NOT use this script with Cygwin because I have NOT tested it yet. If you want to use it with Cygwin you may need to do modifications to this script. 


## TODO
* Make this script universal so it's not just limited to using it with WSL 
* Improve this script syntax to follow POSIX standard: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide http://s.ntnu.no/bashguide.pdf 
### Known Issues 
* This script has NOT been tested on Cygwin on Windows. Do NOT use with Cygwin. If you want to use it with Cygwin you will need to modify this script. 
* This script has NOT been tested on network drives (NFS and SMB (Samba)) mounted drive. 
	* Will need to test mounting/unmount network drives with Ubuntu/Bash WSL on Windows 10
	* Will need to test permissions and ensure no ACL permission issues occur
