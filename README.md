#RbuWSL: Rsync backup using Windows Subsystem for Linux

README is pending. More coming soon. 

## Description
RbuWSL's script will backup your desired data on Windows 10 to an external drive using rsync. Rsync allows differential backup of data allowing only new/modified files to be transferred. On Windows 10, use of rsync can be achieved using Ubuntu (Bash) through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

### Motivation
I needed a faster method to quickly backup all my files on Windows to an external drive. Copying/pasting my users files took too long because non-modified files would be transferred also. With 500GB+ worth of data, this was not a feasible option. I found *rsync* as a solution. Rsync allows you to transfer files from source to destination quickly by only transferring new and modified files. I created RbuWSL for my own personal use so I can quickly automate the backup process to an external drive using rsync.
